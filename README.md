# Lesson 2 Practice (Errors, Debugging & Comments)

Use this repository (repo, for short) to complete your practice for Lesson 2.

## Complete the following:
#### Edpuzzle
* [Edpuzzle practice](src/edpuzzle_practice.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * Use this for practice during the Edpuzzle video. You can use the main window or the Python Console (see button at the bottom of the PyCharm window)

#### Reading (optional) 
* [Debugging: reading from Think Python by Allen B Downey](https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython021.html#:~:text=1%20Syntax%20errors%20are%20produced%20by%20Python%20when,messages%20but%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20do%20the%20right%20thing.%20) ðŸ¥‡

#### Quick check
* On Canvas, complete the Quick Check. Record incorrect answers (along with correct responses and clarifications) in OneNote.

#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](src/fix_code_1.py) ðŸ¥‰
  * Fix the errors in the starter code so it prompts the user for their favorite math class and then responds that it loves that class. 
    * Sample output (input in parentheses): 
      ```
      What is your favorite math class? (algebra)
      I love algebra!
      ```
    * GitHub will test your solution when you submit. See instructions at the end of this page.
### Submitting your Repo
* When you have completed each task, commit and push to GitHub. 
* Go to the repo on GitHub and look for the green check mark (automatic testing passed.)
